		<h1>HTML Reflow</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>	Reflow is the process by which the make up if the layout engine's formatting are computed. Relow is the way the browser sees the page. Formatting objects are called frames, and a frame represents the geometric info for a single element. These frames are arranged into a hierarchy that the browser reads and constructs a web page. </p>
			<p>	HTML incorporates a flow based layout model. This means that it is posible to compute the geometry in a single pass. Elements later in the flow typically do not effect elements earlier in the flow. This allows for the layout to proceed, left-to-right, top-to-bottom, through the document. </P>
