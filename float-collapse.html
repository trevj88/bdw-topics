			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p> 	To Understand Float Collapse it is important to under stand floats.  This site first starts off by describing floats in web format. It explains that floats are a CSS positioning tool. When page elements have float properties applied to them it allows the text in the page to flow around them.  This allows for the floated elements to exist as a part of the flow of the webpage.  If properties do not have float elements then the text in the page will write over a side text box or image. Float properties allow for "text wrap." Making the page easier to follow and legible.</p>
			<p>Floats can affect the parent element and this causes a major visual problem. This is called Float Collapse. If the parent element only contains floated elements than the height would collapse to nothing leaving it covering other elements. This is especially apparent when the floated element has a distinct color background. To fix the float collapse one must apply the clear fix CSS.</p>
