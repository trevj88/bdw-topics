		<h1>HTML Repaint</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>	HTML repaint is similar to reflow. A Repaint is a screen update that is also called a re-draw. A repaint is needed when either changes to gemoetric properties of a node occur or when there is a stylistic change. A stylistic change that requires a repaint would be a change in background color. </p>
			<p>	Repaint happens when the initial layout is rendered with a paint. After the initial layout, changing the input which was used to render the DOM tree may result in a repaint. </P>
